## Data Structure Project

### Requirements
`"Use first, then implement"`
- Purpose of the structure.
- Operations that should be available.

### Memory
How should the data be stored?

- Memory allocation: Having control over the memory used. 
- Dynamic Memory Allocation.

### Proposed Data Structure
- Dynamic Array:
<br> When creating an array, it is not possible to change the initially defined amount of data.
<br> Here, the dynamic array can have its data quantity altered, depending only on the machine.

### Expanding Capacity
Analyzes the area that follows the one being occupied, checks if there is space, and stores if possible.
If not possible, moves the entire structure to another location in memory.
