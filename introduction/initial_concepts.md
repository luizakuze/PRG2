## Concepts

### Data Structures
Ways of storing data in memory to facilitate problem-solving. Examples: Stacks, queues, lists, trees, hash tables.

### Embedded Systems
Software + hardware that together make a "machine" work. Here, programming languages come into play to facilitate the interaction between hardware and software. Example: Earbuds, projector.

### Compiled Language
The compiler transforms the source code into an object code that is read by the computer.

### Interpreted Language
Requires another program to execute the program, called an "interpreter." It adds additional functionality.
