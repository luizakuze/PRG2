## Chapter 1

Linear data structures are essential components in programming and are used 
to organize and manage data in a sequential manner.

In this directory, you can find exercises and materials for each of the linear data structures!!

Here's a brief summary of the commonly used linear data structures:

### Queue
- Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the element that enters first is the first to be removed.
- Elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue).
### Stacks
- Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the element that enters last is the first to be removed.
- Elements are added on top (push) and removed from the top (pop) of the stack.
### Lists
- Lists store elements in a linear sequence and allow dynamic resizing.
- Elements can be inserted or removed at any position.
- A list allows for the insertion and removal of elements at any position.
### Vector
- A dynamic array (vector) also allows for the insertion and removal of elements, but usually only at the end of the sequence.
- Elements in the vector are accessed through an index.
