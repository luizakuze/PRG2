## Projects ✈✨
Here are the projects I have developed throughout the semester. ❣

- **Project 1:** I conducted a study using linear data structures to solve a problem faced by investors when conducting their trades.

- **Project 2:** I developed a project focused on the use of associative data structures, such as a hash table. <br>
I used a logic similar to Dijkstra's algorithm to find the best route and the shortest distance between two cities.

For more information, please access the directories related to the projects :)
