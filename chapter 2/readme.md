Associative data structures allow for efficient access and retrieval of data based on a key-value mapping, such as hash tables or binary trees.

In this directory, you can find exercises and materials for each of the associative data structures!!

Here's a brief summary of the commonly used associative data structures:

### Tabela Hash
- Stores related elements that can be accessed using a key.

### Arvore binaria
- Stores interconnected elements through nodes.
