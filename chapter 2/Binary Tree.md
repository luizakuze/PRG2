## Trees

### Concepts
- Binary Tree: Each element has at most two branches.
- Degree: Number of branches that extend from an element.
- The file explorer can be understood as a tree structure. In the case of Linux, the root would be the initial "/".
- A tree must have an initial point.
- It is a type of graph.
  
### Needs
Approximate Search. <br> When bidirectional decisions need to be made at each point in a process.

### Functioning
The binary search tree operates based on two main ideas:

- Smaller values go to the left branch.
- Larger values go to the right branch.
It's important to note that for strings, "smaller values" refer to preceding values in the alphabetical order, and "larger values" refer to succeeding values.

### Library
The STL library does not provide a generic binary search tree implementation. <br>
In this course, a library implemented by the professor was used.
